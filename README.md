# PWA Project Test

This is a test project for implementing a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Description

This project demonstrates the development of a PWA using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A PWA is a web application that utilizes modern web capabilities to provide a user experience similar to that of native mobile apps, including offline functionality, push notifications, and the ability to install the app on the user's device.

## Features

- **Offline support:** The app can be accessed even when the user is offline, thanks to service worker caching.
- **Responsive design:** The app is optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
- **Install button:** Once you press the Install button, a Prompt will be displayed to install the Application.
- **Add to Home Screen:** Users can install the app on their device's home screen for quick access.
- **Fast and lightweight:** The app is designed to load quickly and efficiently, providing a smooth user experience.
